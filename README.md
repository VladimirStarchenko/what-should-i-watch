# what-should-i-watch

## As a MOVIE VIEWER, I want to SEARCH FOR A FILM BY TITLE OR GENRE so that I can FIND A PLACE TO STREAM THE MOVIE I WANT TO WATCH.

## HTML:

- Creating a charset attribute, covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world

- Creating a H1 tag which will define the importnat heading - Name of the site (putting it under class for styling purposes)
- Creating a p class to hold the text about the website and share the same style
- Creating an <input> tag to specify an input field where the user can enter data
- Creating a search button - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/search
- Creating a section to hold the information on 3 different movies - "our-movies"
- Creating a new div - flex row

- Adding the <article> HTML element which represents a self-contained composition in a page, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication
- Creating a separate div to place the information on the movies inside: h3 will hold the name of the movie, h4 will hold the type of the movie ** per each movie **
