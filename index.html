              Christian Bale and director Christopher Nolan reunite following
              their blockbuster success with Batman Begins! This time, Heath
              Ledger joins the cast as The Joker, and Aaron Eckhart stars as
              Harvey Dent in an all-new adventure of The Dark Knight. With the
              help of Lieutenant Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman) and new district
              attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart--Thank You for Smoking), Batman sets
              out to destroy organized crime in Gotham City forever. The three
              enjoy early success, but they soon find themselves prey to a
              rising criminal mastermind known as The Joker (Ledger--Brokeback
              Mountain), who throws Gotham into anarchy and forces Batman ever
              closer to crossing the line between hero and vigilante.

              Internationally acclaimed actors Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman
              star in a compelling drama of hope, friendship and atonement
              behind the walls of a maximum-security prison in The Shawshank
              Redemption. From a novella by best-selling author Stephen King
              comes a poignant tale of the human spirit. Red (Freeman), serving
              a life sentence, and Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a mild-mannered
              banker wrongly convicted of murder, forge an unlikely bond that
              will span more than twenty years. Together they discover hope as
              the ultimate means of survival. Under horrifying conditions and
              the ever-present threat of violence, two lifers reclaim their
              souls and find freedom within their hearts in The Shawshank
              Redemption.

              Living together in a workers' dorm, Katerina (Vera Alentova) and
              her friends are determined to make it in Moscow. But when a
              boorish cameraman (Juri Wassiliev) forces himself on her, Katerina
              finds herself pregnant and alone as her friends move on. Twenty
              years later, she's fought to become a factory director, outpacing
              her old roommates career-wise, but still alone but for her
              daughter. When she meets a genial mechanic (Aleksey Batalov), love
              seems possible again.
